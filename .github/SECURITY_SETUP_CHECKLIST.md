# GitHub Security Setup Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that GitHub's security features are properly configured for the FlowFi repository.

## Repository Security Settings

### Required Actions (Repository Admin)

- [ ] **Enable Private Vulnerability Reporting**
  - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
  - Enable "Private vulnerability reporting"
  - This allows security researchers to privately report vulnerabilities

- [ ] **Enable Dependency Graph**
  - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
  - Enable "Dependency graph"
  - This helps track project dependencies

- [ ] **Enable Dependabot Alerts**
  - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
  - Enable "Dependabot alerts"
  - This provides automatic vulnerability alerts for dependencies

- [ ] **Enable Dependabot Security Updates**
  - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
  - Enable "Dependabot security updates"
  - This automatically creates PRs to fix vulnerable dependencies

- [ ] **Enable Code Scanning (CodeQL)**
  - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
  - Enable "Code scanning"
  - The security.yml workflow should handle this automatically

- [ ] **Configure Branch Protection**
  - Go to Settings → Branches
  - Add protection rules for `main` branch
  - Require status checks to pass (including security checks)

### Optional but Recommended

- [ ] **Enable Secret Scanning**
  - Go to Settings → Security & analysis
  - Enable "Secret scanning"
  - This detects accidentally committed secrets

- [ ] **Set up Security Policy Link**
  - Verify that SECURITY.md appears in the repository's Security tab
  - GitHub should automatically detect and link to it

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Security Tab
- [ ] Navigate to the repository's "Security" tab
- [ ] Verify that "Security policy" section shows a link to SECURITY.md
- [ ] Confirm that "Report a vulnerability" button is available

### 2. Test Private Reporting
- [ ] Click "Report a vulnerability" in the Security tab
- [ ] Verify that it opens the private advisory creation form
- [ ] Cancel without submitting (this is just a test)

### 3. Verify Workflows
- [ ] Check that `.github/workflows/security.yml` is running on PRs
- [ ] Confirm that security checks appear in PR status checks
- [ ] Review any security alerts in the Security tab

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Review any new Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Check for new security advisories

### Monthly
- [ ] Review and update security policy if needed
- [ ] Audit repository access permissions
- [ ] Review security workflow results

### Before Major Releases
- [ ] Run comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Update supported versions in SECURITY.md
- [ ] Review and test incident response procedures

## Contact Information

Update the following when repository ownership or contact methods change:

- [ ] Security email in SECURITY.md
- [ ] Repository maintainer list
- [ ] Emergency contact procedures

## Notes

- This checklist should be reviewed whenever repository settings change
- New team members should be familiar with the security policy
- Consider setting up notifications for security alerts
