## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of FlowFi seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@flowfi.dev` (if available) or create a private security advisory on GitHub
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/LabsCrypt/flowfi/security/advisories/new) feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to the maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact and severity of the issue
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, or configurations
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with our assessment and planned timeline
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue before any public disclosure
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

FlowFi uses Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar network. Key security considerations include:

- **Audit Status**: Our smart contracts are currently under development and have not been formally audited
- **Testing**: All contracts undergo extensive testing before deployment
- **Upgrades**: Contract upgrade mechanisms follow secure patterns

### Backend Security

Our backend API implements several security measures:

- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **CORS**: Cross-origin requests are properly configured
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored securely

### Frontend Security

The frontend application follows security best practices:

- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure handling of wallet connections and transactions

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using FlowFi, please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Wallet Security**: Never share your private keys or seed phrases
2. **Transaction Verification**: Always verify transaction details before signing
3. **Network Security**: Use secure, trusted networks when accessing FlowFi
4. **Software Updates**: Keep your wallet software and browser up to date
5. **Phishing Protection**: Always verify you're on the official FlowFi domain

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, FlowFi does not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture and will acknowledge their contributions appropriately.

Security updates and advisories will be published:

- In this repository's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/LabsCrypt/flowfi/security/advisories)
